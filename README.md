# PROJECT COUNT DISPLAY ON LCD 16x2 I2C


## OVERVIEW
After completing microcontrollers upto Arduino while doing embedded engineer internship , I try to do implement software in hardware as a project aspects. But I failed. Later on I try to do  projects by incorporating two or more sensors with microcontroller.Here I used ESP8266 microcontroller.


## AIM
To display the count of pushing button on LCD I2C.


## COMPONENTS
1.	ESP8266 NodeMCU
2.	LCD 16x2 I2C
3.	Push Button
4.	Jumper Wire
5.	USB cable

<br> VCC = power supply ---->  3V3
<br> GND = ground          ---->  GND
<br> SDA = serial data line   ---->  D2
<br> SCL = serial clock line   ---->  D1

<br> S = Output     ---->  D6
<br> middle  = power supply  ---->  3V3
<br> â€“  = ground          ---->  GND


## PROCEDURE

<br> Step 1 : Interface ESP8266 microcontroller to Arduino IDE using port.
<br> Step 2: Interface ESP8266 microcontroller with push button and print the digital values on serial monitor.
<br> Step 3 : Interface ESP8266 microcontroller with LCD 16x2 I2C to display HI on LCD
<br> Step 4 : Interface ESP8266 microcontroller with LCD 16x2 I2C and push button by modifying both the programs.


## PROBLEMS FACED

### Error 1 -   While compiling , a error message keep showing starts with " A fatal esptool.py......." 
#### How to rectify:
<br> (1) Make sure Board managers are  updated 
<br> Update the board packages for ESP8266 through the Arduino IDE. Navigate to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search for ESP8266 , and click Install or Update if there are newer versions available.
<br> (2)  Install USB Drivers (if applicable):
<br> If you're using a development board that requires specific USB drivers (especially for Windows), make sure these drivers are installed correctly. Check the documentation provided with your board.  
<br> (3)  Reinstall Arduino IDE
<br> As a last resort, if none of the above steps work, try reinstalling the Arduino IDE. Uninstall it completely, then download and install the latest version from the official Arduino website.       
<br> (4)  Restart computer
<br> As a last resort, if none of the above steps work, try restarting the 
system
### Error 2 -   Display cleared when nothing is done.
#### How to rectify:
- put some delay() after closing if loop in void loop.
### Error 3 -   Count numbers  keep on printing aside of "count ="
#### How to rectify:
- lcd.setCursor(c,r) function is used to print on the same column by eliminating previous count number by present count number.
